SublimeLinter-pep257
-------------------------------

"add-ignore" config option has been added to SublimeLinter-pep257.
This addition was because of changes to "ignore" functionality. Both
options can now be found in the SublimeLinter User settings. Some
may find that their "ignore" setting is now broken. If that is the case,
you may want to use the "add-ignore" config setting instead. Below
you will find a brief description of each setting to help you understand

"ignore": overrides the default list of disabled errors
"add-ignore": appends list on top of default list of disabled errors

As always thank you for using SublimeLinter!
